# TrustBridge

Integration prototype between **TrustBridge** and **Blend.Capital** enabling **cross-chain lending** on the Stellar blockchain using bridged assets and Blend's permissionless lending infrastructure.

üîó Built on Stellar + Soroban  
üß™ MVP running on testnet  
üí± Use case: Interoperable Lending with bridged assets (e.g., USDC, BLND)  
üè™ **NEW**: Complete marketplace interface with pool deployment and borrowing functionality

## Features

### üè¶ TrustBridge-MicroLoans Pool
- **Multi-asset support**: USDC, XLM, and TBRG token reserves
- **Oracle integration**: Real-time price feeds for accurate collateral valuation
- **Risk management**: Configurable collateral factors and liquidation thresholds
- **Pool deployment**: One-click deployment of lending pools via Blend Protocol

### üí∞ Marketplace Interface
- **Dashboard**: Comprehensive overview of pool statistics and user positions
- **Borrow Flow**: Intuitive USDC borrowing with real-time health factor calculation
- **Wallet Integration**: Seamless Freighter wallet connection and transaction signing
- **Health Monitoring**: Live collateral ratio and liquidation risk tracking

### üîß Technical Implementation
- **Blend SDK v2.2.0**: Complete integration with Blend Protocol's lending infrastructure
- **Pool Factory**: Automated deployment using Blend's PoolFactoryContract
- **Smart Contracts**: Proper Stellar testnet contract addresses and configurations
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe implementation with comprehensive error handling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Freighter wallet extension installed
- Stellar testnet account with funded XLM

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dApp-TrustBridge.git
cd dApp-TrustBridge/frontend
npm install
```

2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure the following variables:
   - Blend contract addresses
   - Wallet address  
   - RPC or Soroban network details (testnet or mainnet)

3. Launch the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Navigate to the marketplace:
   - Open `http://localhost:3000`
   - Go to Dashboard ‚Üí Marketplace
   - Connect your Freighter wallet

### Pool Deployment

1. **Connect Wallet**: Click "Connect Wallet" and approve Freighter connection
2. **Deploy Pool**: Click "Deploy Pool" to create the TrustBridge-MicroLoans pool
3. **Wait for Confirmation**: Transaction will be signed and submitted to Stellar testnet
4. **Start Borrowing**: Once deployed, use "Borrow USDC" to access lending functionality

## Architecture Overview

### Smart Contract Integration
- **TrustBridge Contracts**: Handle asset bridging and cross-chain messaging
- **Blend Protocol**: Manages lending, borrowing, and liquidations in a permissionless environment
- **Oracle Contract**: Provides real-time price feeds for collateral valuation
- **Pool Factory**: Deploys and configures lending pools with custom parameters

## Usage Examples

### Deploy a Lending Pool
```typescript
import { deployCompletePool } from '@/helpers/pool-deployment.helper';

// Deploy TrustBridge-MicroLoans pool
const poolId = await deployCompletePool(walletAddress);
console.log('Pool deployed:', poolId);
```

### Borrow USDC
```typescript
import { PoolContract, RequestType } from '@blend-capital/blend-sdk';

// Create borrow transaction
const pool = new PoolContract(TRUSTBRIDGE_POOL_ID);
const borrowOpXdr = pool.submit({
  from: walletAddress,
  spender: walletAddress,
  to: walletAddress,
  requests: [{
    request_type: RequestType.Borrow,
    address: TOKENS.USDC,
    amount: BigInt(amount * 1e7), // USDC has 7 decimals
  }],
});

// Sign with Freighter
const signedTx = await signTransaction({
  unsignedTransaction: borrowOpXdr,
  address: walletAddress
});
```

## Pool Configuration

### TrustBridge-MicroLoans Parameters
- **Backstop Rate**: 15% - Fee charged for backstop provider protection
- **Max Positions**: 4 - Maximum number of concurrent user positions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Wallet Connection Failed**
   - Ensure Freighter extension is installed and unlocked
   - Check that you're on Stellar testnet
   - Verify wallet has sufficient XLM for transaction fees

2. **Pool Deployment Failed**  
   - Confirm Pool Factory contract address is correct
   - Check network connectivity to Stellar testnet
   - Ensure wallet has sufficient XLM balance (minimum 1 XLM recommended)

3. **Borrow Transaction Failed**
   - Verify pool is deployed and active
   - Check sufficient collateral is deposited
   - Ensure borrow amount doesn't exceed health factor limits
